* **Interactive UI:** A clean and evolving user interface to easily interact with your financial data and AI insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a full-stack application leveraging a Python backend with FastAPI and a React frontend with TypeScript.

**(Refer to the architecture diagram for a visual overview)**

### Backend
* **Framework:** Python with FastAPI
* **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API for generating budget recommendations and savings tips
* **Database:** SQLite for storing expenses and tracked savings goals
* **Data Validation:** Pydantic
* **Asynchronous Operations:** `aiohttp` for internal agent communication, FastAPI's async capabilities.
* **Key Modules:**
    * `main.py`: Core FastAPI application setup.
    * `agents.py`: Handles AI agent logic, Gemini API interaction, and defines agent-related endpoints.
    * `database.py`: Manages all SQLite database interactions.
    * `mcp_tools.py`: For multi-capability provider tools (e.g., fetching cost-of-living data - currently mocked).
    * `models.py`: Defines Pydantic data models.

### Frontend
* **Framework/Library:** React with TypeScript
* **Development Environment:** Node.js
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (assuming `index.css` and `tailwind.config.js` are correctly set up for Tailwind).
* **API Calls:** Axios
* **Component Structure:** Organized into reusable UI components (e.g., `ExpenseForm.tsx`, `BudgetDashboard.tsx`, and others under `src/components/ui/`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get Budget Buddy running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
* Git

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd budget-buddy
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  #On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    *(Uses dependencies like FastAPI, Uvicorn, google-generativeai, Pydantic, aiohttp from `requirements.txt`)*
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root `budget-buddy` directory.
    * Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
5.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will typically be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).

##  (How to Use)

1.  Open the frontend application in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
2.  Use the "Add New Expense" form to input your expenses (category, amount, date).
3.  Upon submission, the application will process the expense and display:
    * AI-generated budget recommendations.
    * AI-generated savings tips.
4.  You can click "Track this Goal" for any savings tip you find useful.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* **UI/UX Overhaul:** Continuously refine the user interface for a sleeker and more interactive experience.
* **Dynamic City Input & Real Cost-of-Living Data:** Allow users to set their city and integrate a real API (like Numbeo) for cost-of-living data to enhance AI advice.
* **View & Manage Tracked Goals:** Display a list of tracked savings goals and allow users to update their status (e.g., "achieved").
* **Spending Trends & Visualizations:** Add charts and graphs to visualize spending patterns.
* **User Accounts & Authentication:** Implement user accounts for personalized data storage and experience.
